## Overview of public repositories

### Software libraries

1. [lvgp-bayes](https://github.com/syerramilli/lvgp-bayes): A python library for estimating latent variable Gaussian process regression models using either point estimation or fully Bayesian (i.e. MCMC) methods. Related publication: https://doi.org/10.1137/22M1525600
2. [gp-bo](https://github.com/syerramilli/gp-bo): A python library for Bayesian optimization (BO) using Gaussian process as the surrogate model, built on top of [BoTorch](https://botorch.org/). While BoTorch has functions and classes for implementing BO, this library contains settings and models that I found to be useful in practice and in my research. The library can also be used with [Optuna](https://optuna.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
3. [sysid](https://github.com/syerramilli/R-sysid): An R library for system-identification. The library contains routines for input design, simulation and standard estimation methods for understanding the subject of and developing data-driven models for linear-time invariant (LTI) systems. Related publication: https://doi.org/10.1109/INDIANCC.2017.7846451

### Projects

1. [LSTMs for Hangman game](https://github.com/syerramilli/hangman_solver): LSTM based approach for guessing the letters in the classic Hangman game.
2. [Shiny apps](https://github.com/syerramilli/r-shiny-practice): Repository containing R shiny apps that I developed for showcasing various visualization aspects
3. [BNN project](https://github.com/syerramilli/iems490bnn): Course project for evaluating several scalable approaches for Bayesian Neural Networks in terms of prediction accuracy, uncertainty quantification, and computation time.

### Lab / Tutorial archives from teaching assignments:

1. [msia420-w2023-lab](https://github.com/syerramilli/msia420-w2023-lab): Python labs for the Winter 2023 iteration of MSIA 420 Predictive Analytics II
2. [iems308-lab](https://github.com/syerramilli/iems308_lab): Python tutorial for the Winter 2019 iteration of IEMS 308 Data Science & Analytics
3. [Scrapy tutorial](https://github.com/syerramilli/scrapy_tutorial): Web scraping tutorial prepared for the Spring 2023 iteration of DATA_ENG 300 Data Engineering Studio

### Miscellaneous:

1. [Kaggle notebooks](https://github.com/syerramilli/kaggle-notebooks): A collection of (mostly Python) notebooks run on the Kaggle platform.
