I am a PhD candidate at Industrial Engineering & Management Sciences. My research focuses on adaptive experimental design, applied machine learning, Gaussian processes, and uncertainty quantification. 

## Overview of public repositories

### Software libraries

1. [lvgp-bayes](https://github.com/syerramilli/lvgp-bayes): A python library for estimating latent variable Gaussian process regression models using either point estimation or fully Bayesian (i.e. MCMC) methods. 
2. [sysid](https://github.com/syerramilli/R-sysid): An R library for system-identification. 

### Lab / Tutorial archives from teaching assignments:

1. [msia420-w2023-lab](https://github.com/syerramilli/msia420-w2023-lab): Python labs for the Winter 2023 iteration of MSIA 420 Predictive Analytics II
2. [iems308-lab](https://github.com/syerramilli/iems308_lab): Python tutorial for the Winter 2019 iteration of IEMS 308 Data Science & Analytics
